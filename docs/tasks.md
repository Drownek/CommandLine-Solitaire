# Pasjans Gigathon Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the Pasjans Gigathon codebase. Each task is marked with
a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture and Code Organization

[ ] 1. Complete the refactoring of game logic from widgets to controllers

- [ ] Move card interaction logic from Card.on_click to CardInteractController
- [ ] Create additional controllers for other game components (tableau, foundation, etc.)
- [ ] Update widgets to use controllers instead of containing game logic

[ ] 2. Implement proper dependency injection

- [ ] Replace static class variables with instance variables where appropriate
- [ ] Pass dependencies explicitly rather than accessing them through global state
- [ ] Consider using a dependency injection framework or pattern

[ ] 3. Improve state management

- [ ] Refactor GameStateManager to use instance variables instead of static variables
- [ ] Implement a configurable undo limit rather than hardcoding it
- [ ] Consider implementing a more memory-efficient state storage mechanism

[ ] 4. Separate UI concerns from game logic

- [ ] Create a clear separation between game state and UI representation
- [ ] Implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern

[ ] 5. Reduce code duplication

- [ ] Extract common functionality into reusable methods
- [ ] Create utility classes for shared operations
- [ ] Use inheritance or composition to share behavior between similar components

## Documentation and Comments

[ ] 6. Improve code documentation

- [ ] Add or improve docstrings for all classes and methods
- [ ] Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- [ ] Add type hints consistently throughout the codebase

[ ] 7. Create architectural documentation

- [ ] Document the overall system architecture
- [ ] Create component diagrams showing relationships between classes
- [ ] Document design decisions and rationales

[ ] 8. Add user documentation

- [ ] Create a comprehensive user guide
- [ ] Document game rules and controls
- [ ] Add tooltips or help text within the application

## Testing Infrastructure

[ ] 9. Implement unit testing

- [ ] Set up a testing framework (pytest recommended)
- [ ] Write unit tests for core game logic
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for common test scenarios

[ ] 10. Add integration tests

- [ ] Test interactions between components
- [ ] Test game state transitions
- [ ] Test undo/redo functionality

[ ] 11. Implement UI testing

- [ ] Test UI rendering and interactions
- [ ] Test keyboard and mouse input handling
- [ ] Test accessibility features

[ ] 12. Set up continuous integration

- [ ] Configure automated test runs on code changes
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement linting and static analysis

## Performance Optimizations

[ ] 13. Optimize rendering performance

- [ ] Reduce unnecessary UI refreshes
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for UI components
- [ ] Profile and optimize rendering bottlenecks

[ ] 14. Improve memory usage

- [ ] Optimize game state storage
- [ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- [ ] Fix any memory leaks

[ ] 15. Enhance startup time

- [ ] Optimize resource loading
- [ ] Implement asynchronous initialization where appropriate
- [ ] Consider lazy loading of non-essential components

## User Experience Enhancements

[ ] 16. Improve game controls

- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop card movement
- [ ] Add visual feedback for valid/invalid moves

[ ] 17. Enhance visual design

- [ ] Create additional themes
- [ ] Improve card and UI element styling
- [ ] Add animations for card movements and game events

[ ] 18. Add accessibility features

- [ ] Implement screen reader support
- [ ] Add high contrast mode
- [ ] Support keyboard-only navigation

[ ] 19. Enhance game features

- [ ] Add difficulty levels
- [ ] Implement game statistics tracking
- [ ] Add save/load game functionality

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

[ ] 20. Update dependencies

- [ ] Review and update all dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Address any security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Document dependency management process

[ ] 21. Refactor error handling

- [ ] Implement consistent error handling throughout the application
- [ ] Add proper error messages and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Log errors for debugging purposes

[ ] 22. Clean up code style

- [ ] Ensure consistent code formatting
- [ ] Remove commented-out code and TODOs
- [ ] Apply consistent naming conventions

[ ] 23. Improve build and deployment process

- [ ] Create a streamlined build process
- [ ] Set up automated deployment
- [ ] Add version management
